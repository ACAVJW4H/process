\subsection{Isolation}
For the isolation (\autoref{sti})  in this design the STI approach is being chosen.
Shallow trench isolation (STI), also known as box isolation technique, is an integrated circuit feature which prevents electric current leakage between adjacent semiconductor device components.\footnote{\url{https://www.google.com/patents/US7985656}}
STI is generally used on CMOS process technology nodes of 250 nanometers and smaller.\\

\textbf{Reasons for using box isolation}:\begin{itemize}
\item We want to be forward compatible to future LibreSilicon nodes with a size of 100nm or smaller
\item It simplifies the construction of the gate and allows us to use Aluminum instead of Polysilicon for the gate contact
\end{itemize}
