In overall the lambda rules from MOSIS are sufficient for keeping it manufacturable but just for completion we accumulate all the edge parameters arising from using the HKUST equipment which we are using for this open process in this chapter.

The layout shown in \autoref{design_rules_example_inverter} is for demonstration purposes only and shows a circuit at the limit of our resolution with $\lambda = 0.5 \mu m$.

This process however will, as already stated so many times through out this document, only be tested with a $\lambda$ of $1.0 \mu m$ for now.

Please have a look at the LS1U technology standard logic cells in our repository.
