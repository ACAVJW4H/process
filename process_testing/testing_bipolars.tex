\section{Bipolar transistors}
A byproduct of the Bulk CMOS structure is a pair of parasitic bipolar transistors.\footnote{\url{http://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/winning-the-battle-against-latchup.html}}
The collector of each BJT is connected to the base of the other transistor in a positive feedback structure.
A phenomenon called latchup can occur when both BJT's conduct, creating a low resistance path between VDD and GND and the product of the gains of the two transistors in the feedback loop $\beta_1 \times \beta_2$ is greater than one.
The result of latchup is at the minimum a circuit malfunction, and in the worst case, the destruction of the device.

In \autoref{latchup_diagram} we can see the two above mentioned transistors. In order to find out their average $\beta$ we split it up into two separate test circuits, allowing us to measure their properties out with probes on our test wafer.

\subsection{Lateral bipolar transistor}

We split out the lateral bipolar junction transistor for testing.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=0.5, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_testing/lateral_bjt_cross_section.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Lateral BJT cross section}
	\label{lateral_bjt_cross_section}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{lateral_bjt_cross_section} the cross section of our testing circuit can be seen.
Now we can characterize the $\beta$ value of the lateral bipolar transistor all over the wafer and get a good approximation of the worst case conditions.

\subsection{Vertical bipolar transistor}

We split out the vertical bipolar junction transistor for testing.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto, thick,scale=0.5, every node/.style={transform shape}]
		\input{tikz_testing/vertical_bjt_cross_section.tex}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Vertical BJT cross section}
	\label{vertical_bjt_cross_section}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{vertical_bjt_cross_section} the cross section of our testing circuit can be seen.
Now we can characterize the $\beta$ value of the vertical bipolar transistor all over the wafer and get a good approximation of the worst case conditions.
