# Libre Silicon v0.1
This is the LibreSilicon process specification (WIP)
Please use XeLaTeX for rendering the documents

Features are:

* 1 micron (1 um)
* twin-well for cmos
* pbase / nbase (optional) for bipolar
* shallow trench isolation
* sonos for flash (optional)
* silicification

aiming higher voltages, higher speed and higher feasibilty for modern Analog and System-on-Chip design.
