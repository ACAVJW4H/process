\subsection{Optical limitations}
When looking at the mask making module "Intertech ISI-2808 Laser Direct Write System" from HKUST \footnote{\url{http://www.nff.ust.hk/en/equipment-and-process/equipment-list/mask-making-module.html}} we see the following limitations for the lithographic masks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Minimum Feature Size of the Laser system is 1.5\um. Any pattern size less than 1.5\um may not come out.
	\item The grid of the Laser system is 0.25\um, any off grid pattern will be round off or up to the grid location
\end{itemize}

So the smallest structure \textbf{on the mask} shall be bigger than 1.5\um

If we look at the stepper "ASML Stepper (PHT-S1)" from HKUST\footnote{\url{http://www.nff.ust.hk/en/equipment-and-process/equipment-list/photolithography-module.html}} we see it has a resolution of 0.5\um and a reduction ratio of 5:1

This mean that our feature sizes on the wafer can be around 0.5\um or even 0.3\um !
