\subsection{PMOS threshold}\label{pmos_dimensioning}
Now we take a look at the worst case of 4 stacked PMOS transistors, which is the highest stacking amount which will be possible in technologies relying on this process.

With our $\phi_F$ for a doped n-well
\begin{equation}
\phi_F
=
V_{th} ln\left(\frac{{N_A \cdot N_D}}{N_i^2}\right)
\end{equation}
