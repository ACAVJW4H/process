\subsection{Shallow trench isolation}\label{sti}
Shallow trench isolation (STI), also known as box isolation technique, is an integrated circuit feature which prevents electric current leakage between adjacent semiconductor device components.
STI is generally used on CMOS process technology nodes of 250 nanometers and smaller.
Older CMOS technologies and non-MOS technologies commonly use isolation based on LOCOS.

The geometry of a substrate with STI implemented can be seen in \autoref{sti_target}.

We choose the STI approach because we wanna scale the technology node down in the future below 250nm and wanna ensure backwards compatibility of our process.
