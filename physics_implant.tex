\subsection{Ion implant}
We can use the following equation to calculate the carrier distribution after implantation:
\begin{equation}
N(x)
=
N_p \exp\left(-\frac{(x-R_p)^2}{2\Delta R_p^2}\right)
=
\frac{Q}{\sqrt{2\pi}\Delta R_p}\exp\left(-\frac{(x-R_p)^2}{2\Delta R_p^2}\right)
\end{equation}

Where the projected range ($R_p$) and the projected straggle ($\Delta R_p$) need to be looked up in tables or looked up using an online tool like the one linked in the footnote\footnote{\url{http://cleanroom.byu.edu/rangestraggle}}
