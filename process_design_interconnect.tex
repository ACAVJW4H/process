\subsection{Interconnect}
The interconnects and the gate electrode are being made using Aluminum which is a very commonly used material to do interconnects in low-frequency and low-resolution applications \\

\textbf{Reasons for using Aluminum}:\begin{itemize}
\item It's a well explored material for interconnect with a lot of literature on how to process it
\item Aluminum is easy to etch compared to copper
\item It isn't contaminating everything like copper does and doesn't require special separated setup for handling
\item The machines at HKUST can do CMP for copper only on 4 inch wafers which would limit us in wafer size
\end{itemize}

As soon as we've got CMOS all figured out, we will tackle copper interconnect in release 2.0
