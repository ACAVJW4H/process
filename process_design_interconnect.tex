\subsection{Interconnect}
The interconnects and the gate electrode are being made using Aluminum which is a very commonly used material to do interconnects in low-frequency and low-resolution applications \\

\textbf{Reasons for using Aluminum}:\begin{itemize}
\item It's a well explored material for interconnect with a lot of literature on how to process it
\item Aluminum is easy to etch compared to copper
\item Aluminum isn't contaminating everything like copper does and doesn't require special separated setup for handling
\item There are many technology nodes even down to 180nm which still are using Aluminum and it's not having a big impact on the clock frequencies, so it should be good enough for us as well.
\end{itemize}

As soon as we've got CMOS all figured out, we will tackle copper interconnect in release 2.0
