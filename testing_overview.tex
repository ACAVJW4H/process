In order to get an idea on how strongly the actual product differs from the mathematical models being used before hand to define the initial parameters, one has to run a bunch of test wafers through the process over and over again, tweak parameters and measure out all kinds of aspects of the device.

This is also important for gathering the data which will finally end up within the data sheet.

In this chapter we will tackle the multiple different measurement and test objects we will need to put into the seal area during production in order to ensure the consistent quality of the chips we're going to sell in the end.\\

\textbf{Testing parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The capacity per $m^2$ from the n-well to the gate electrode
	\item The capacity per $m^2$ from  the p-well to the gate electrode
	\item The actual resistance/m of the p-well
	\item The actual resistance/m of the n-well
	\item The actual resistance/m of the poly layer
	\item NMOS as well as PMOS:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Frequency characteristics (Transient curve)
		\item Drain-source resistance vs. gate-source voltage
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
