In order to get an idea on how strongly the actual product differs from the mathematical models being used before hand to define the initial parameters, one has to run a bunch of test wafers through the process over and over again, tweak parameters and measure out all kinds of aspects of the device.

This is also important for gathering the data which will finally end up within the data sheet.

In this chapter we will tackle the multiple different measurement and test objects we will need to put into the seal area during production in order to ensure the consistent quality of the chips we're going to sell in the end.
