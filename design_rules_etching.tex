\subsection{Etching limitations}
We have established in \autoref{design_rules_lithographic} that our lithographic lower limit is 0.5\um.
Now in this chapter we look at the different etching machines used for determining their minimum line spacing.

\subsubsection{Poly etching}
Because the "Poly Etcher (DRY-Poly)"(\autoref{poly_etcher_machine}) has minimum line space of 0.5\um we are not limited any further beyond what the lithographic limits are.
The poly layer as well requires a minimum line space of 0.5\um

\subsubsection{Oxide etching}
Because the "Trion RIE Etcher (DRY-Trion)"(\autoref{trion_RIE_etch_machine}) has no minimum line space defined we are not limited any further beyond what the lithographic limits are.
This means that the oxide etching as well requires a minimum line space of 0.5\um.

This plays into the construction design rules for vias and the like.
