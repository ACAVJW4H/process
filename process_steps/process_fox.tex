\section{Field oxide}\label{fox_chapter}

The geometry of a substrate with the field oxide filling the shallow trenched from \autoref{sti_chapter} now needs to be made.

\end{figure}

As can be seen in \autoref{fox_target}, the STI trenches need to be filled with silicon oxide and windows need to be etched into them so that the gate can be constructed later on.
The windows are needed so that the poly silicon is far enough away from the non-active areas so that the threshold voltage of the parasitic FETs is so high that they will never switch.
Only within the active areas we want to allow the poly layer to touch down closer to the silicon.
