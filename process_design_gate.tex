\subsection{MOS gate}
The wires and the MOS gates can be modeled as an RC low-pass filter, for that reason the time constant $\tau=RC$ is limiting the clock frequency of our CMOS circuitry.
However, we can't just make the gate ultra thin, because lowered capacity also creates lowered thresholds, which will be a very big problem, as soon as we go into the 100nm range and lower.

We arbitrarily defined the thickness of the gate to be $t_{ox}=40 nm=40 \cdot 10^{-9}m$ which leads to a oxide capacity of 
\begin{equation}
C_{ox}=\frac{\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}
\end{equation}

With the variables being:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \cdot 10âˆ’12 \frac{F}{m}. $ is the electric permittivity in vacuum
\item $\epsilon_{Si} =3.9 \cdot \epsilon_0$ is the relative permittivity of silicon dioxide
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow
C_{ox}=\frac{\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} = 862.875*10^-6 F = 862 uF
\end{equation}
