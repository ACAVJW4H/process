\subsection{MOS gate}
The wires and the MOS gates can be modeled as an RC low-pass filter, for that reason the time constant $\tau=RC$ is limiting the clock frequency of our CMOS circuitry.
However, we can't just make the gate ultra thin, because lowered capacity also creates lowered thresholds, which will be a very big problem, as soon as we go into the 100nm range and lower.

We arbitrarily defined the thickness of the gate to be $t_{ox}=40 nm=40 \cdot 10^{-9}m=4 \cdot 10^{-8}m=4 \cdot 10^{-6}cm$ which leads to the oxide capacity with the variables being:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \cdot 10^{−14}\frac{F}{cm}. $ is the electric permittivity in vacuum
\item $\epsilon_{Si} =3.9 \cdot \epsilon_0$ is the relative permittivity of silicon dioxide
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow
C_{ox}
=
\frac{\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}
=
\frac{3.9 \cdot 8.85 \cdot 10^{−14} \frac{F}{cm}}{4 \cdot 10^{-6}cm}
=
2.2125 \cdot 10^{-8} F
=
\underline{22.125 nF}
\end{equation}
